(and scaled eqivivalents)\n\n- Fix: Histogram \"Levels\": prevent crash when factor=0.0\n\n- Fix: Histogram \"Levels\": fix regression incorrect \"factor\" applied for U/V part drawing when format was subsampled (non-444)\n  Regression since 20160916 r2666 (commit 986e275)\n\n- Histogram \"Audiolevels\" and StereoOverlay to deny planar RGB\n\n- Histogram \"Luma\": support 10-16 and 32 bits\n\n- Histogram: give parameter name \"factor\" and type 'float' for Histogram's unnamed optional parameter used in \"Level\" mode.\n  Other modes just ignore this parameter if given.\n\n- Fix: Histogram \"color\" may crash on certain dimensions for subsampled formats.\n  Regression since 20180301 r2632.\n\n- Fix: Histogram \"color\" and \"color2\" mode check and give error on Planar RGB\n\n- Fix: missing Histogram \"color2\" CCIR rectangle top and bottom line (black on black)\n  Regression since 3.6.2-test1 (commit 1fc82f0)\n\n- Fix: Compare to support 10-14 bits\n  was: factor was always using 65535 (2^16-1) instead of (2^bit depth - 1)\n  was: 16 bit luma/rgb color values were used for drawing graph\n\n- Fix: Compare\n  'channels' parameter default to \"Y\" when input is greyscale;\n  instead of \"YUV\" which was giving error because of U and V does not exist for this format.\n\n- ShowRed/Green/Blue/Alpha/Y/U/V\n\n  - support YUY2 input\n\n  - support YV411 output\n\n  - (not changed: ShowU/ShowV may give error for 420, 422 or 411 format outputs when clip dimensions are\n    not eligible for a given output subsampling (check for appropriate mod2 or mod4 width or height)\n\n  - Copy alpha from source when target is alpha-capable\n\n  - Fill alpha with maximum pixel value when target is alpha-capable but source ha no alpha component\n\n  - Delete _Matrix and _ChromaLocation frame properties when needed.\n\n  - More consistent behaviour for YUV and planar RGB sources.\n\n    Default pixel_type is adaptive. If none or empty (\"\") is given for pixel_type then target format is\n\n    - YUV444 when source is Y, YUV or YUVA\n    - RGB32/64 (packed RGB) when source is RGB24/32/48/64\n    - RGBP (planar RGB) when source is RGBP or RGBAP\n\n    When 'rgb' is given for pixel_type then then target format is\n\n    - RGB32/64 (packed) when source is RGB24/32/48/64 - old, compatible way\n    - RGB planar when source is planar RGB(A) or YUV(A) or Y - changed from rgb32/64 because all bit depth must be supported\n\n    When 'yuv' is given (new option!) for pixel_type then then target format is\n\n    - YUV444 for all sources\n\n    Also there is a new option when pixel_type is still not exact, and is given w/o bit depth.\n    pixel_type which describes the format without bit depth is automatically extended to a valid video string constant:\n\n    y, yuv420, yuv422, yuv444, yuva420, yuva422, yuva444, rgbp, rgbap\n\n    Examples:\n\n    32 bit video and pixel_type 'y' will result in \"Y32\"\n    16 bit video and pixel_type 'yuv444' will result in \"YUV444P16\"\n    8 bit video and pixel_type 'rgbap' will result in \"RGBAP8\"\n\n- Fix #263. Escaping double-quotes results in error\n\n- Allow top_left (2) and bottom_left (4) chroma placements for 422 in colorspace conversions, they act as \"left\" (0, \"mpeg2\")\n  in order not to give error with video sources which have _ChromaLocation set to other than \"mpeg2\"\n  See https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9598#comment:5\n\n- Fix: Expr LUT operation Access Violation on x86 + AVX2 due to an unaligned internal buffer (<32 bytes)\n\n- Fix: Chroma full scale as ITU Rec H.273 (e.g +/-127.5 and not +/-127) in internal converters, ColorYUV and Histogram\n\n- Fix #257: regression in 3.7.1: GreyScale to not convert to limited range when input is RGB. Regression in 3.7.1\n  Accepts only matrix names of limited range as it is put in the documentation.\n\n- Fix #256: ColorYUV(analyse=true) to not set _ColorRange property to \"full\" if input has no such\n  property and range cannot be 100% sure established. In general: when no _ColorRange for input and\n  no parameter which would rely on a supposed default (such as full range for gamma), then an\n  output frame property is not added.\n  When no _ColorRange for input and no other parameters to hint color range then\n\n  - gamma<>0 sets full range\n  - opt=\"coring\" sets limited range\n  - otherwise no _ColorRange for output would be set\n\n- Overlay (#255): \"blend\": using accurate formula using float calculation. 8 bit basic case is slower now when opacity=1.0.\n  Higher bit depths and opacity<1.0 cases are quicker.\n  Mask processing suffered from inaccuracy. For speed reasons mask value 0 to 255 were handled\n  as mask/256 instead of mask/255. Since with such calculation maximum value was not the expected 1.0 but rather 255/256 (0.996)\n  this case was specially treated as 1.0 to give Overlay proper results at least the the two extremes.\n  But for example applying mask=129 to pixel=255 resulted in result_pixel=128 instead of 129. This was valid on higher bit depths as well.\n  Note 3.7.2 Test2 has a regression of broken maskless mode for 0<opacity<1 which was fixed in 3.7.2 test 3\n\n- Fix: Attempt to resolve deadlock when an Eval'd (Prefetch inside) Clip result is\n  used in Invoke which calls a filter with GetFrame in its constructor.\n  (AvsPMod use case which Invokes frame prop read / ConvertToRGB32 after having the AVS script evaluated)\n  Remark: problem emerged in 3.7.1test22 which is trying to read frame properties of the 0th frame in its constructor.\n  A similar deadlock situation was already fixed earlier in Neo branch and had been backported but it did not cover this use case.\n  Note: Prefetch(1) case was fixed in 3.7.2 Test3","ReleaseNotesUrl":"https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus/releases/tag/v3.7.2"},"zh-CN":{"Tags":["avisynth","avs","avs+","帧服务器"],"Publisher":"The Public","PublisherUrl":"https://avs-plus.net/","Description":"AviSynth+ 是著名的帧服务器的一个分支，但其社区贡献直到现在都在避免包含主线。为了能够促进 AviSynth 现代化以满足当今的需求和期望，该项目鼓励每个人帮助实现我们的目标：添加一直寻求的特性，为社区注入活力，并提高开发者和用户的友好性。AviSynth+ 与为 AviSynth 编写的插件和脚本完全兼容。","License":"GPL-2.0","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":"https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus/releases/tag/v3.7.1"}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Avidemux.Avidemux":{"version":"2.8.0.220109","InstallerType":"nullsoft","Platform":["Windows.Desktop"],"locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["video-editor","video","editor","foss","cross-platform","cutting","filtering","encoding","admin","multimedia"],"Publisher":"Avidemux","PublisherUrl":"http://avidemux.sourceforge.net","Description":"Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks.\nIt supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs.\nTasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities.","License":"GPL-2.0","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Avocode.Avocode":{"version":"4.15.6","Platform":["Windows.Desktop"],"locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["css","design","developing","psd","share","upload"],"Publisher":"Avocode","PublisherUrl":null,"Description":"One workspace open to all designers and developers","License":"Proprietary","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Avogadro.Avogadro":{"version":"1.2.0","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["chemistry","molecules","qt","visualization","modeling","rendering"],"Publisher":"Humanity","PublisherUrl":"https://avogadro.cc/","Description":"Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas.

I removed the extract options/subscriptions sql scripts since they are super old and out of date, but this general system may return in future\n\nfile history chart\n• added 'archive' line to the file history chart. this isn't exactly (current_count - inbox_count), but it pretty much is\n• added a 'show deleted' checkbox to the file history chart. it will recalculate the y axis range on click, so if you have loads of deleted files, you can now hide them to see current better\n• improved the way data is aggregated in the file history chart. diagonal lines should be reduced during any periods of client import-inactivity, and spikes should show better\n• also bumped the number of steps up to 8,000, so it should look nice maximised on a 4k\n• the file history chart now remembers its last size and position--it has an entry under options->gui\n\nclient api\n• thanks to a user, the Client API now accepts any file_id, file_ids, hash, or hashes as arguments in any place where you need to specify a file or files\n• like 'return_hashes', the 'search_files' command in the Client API now takes an optional 'return_file_ids' parameter, default true, to turn off the file ids if you only want hashes\n• added 'only_return_basic_information' parameter, default false, to 'get_metadata' call, which is fast for first-time requests (it is slim but not well cached) and just delivers the basics like resolution and file size\n• added unit tests and updated the help to reflect the above\n• client api version is now 29\n\nhelp\n• split up the 'more files' help section into 'powerful searching' and 'exporting files', both still under the 'next steps' section\n• moved the semi-advanced 'OR' section from 'tags' to 'searching'\n• brushed up misc help\n• a couple of users added some misc help updates too, thank you!\n\nmisc boring cleanup\n• cleaned up an old wx label patch\n• cleaned up an old wx system colour patch\n• cleaned up some misc initialisation code","ReleaseNotesUrl":"https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus/releases/tag/v479a"}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Hypermodules.Hyperamp":{"version":"0.6.3","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":[],"Publisher":"Hypermodules","PublisherUrl":null,"Description":"Indescribable music player","License":"GPL-3.0","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"HyperspaceDev.HyperspaceDesktop":{"version":"1.1.4","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["electron","material-design","reactjs","material-ui","mastodon"],"Publisher":"Marquis Kurt","PublisherUrl":"https://github.com/hyperspacedev/hyperspace","Description":"Socialize and communicate with your friends in the fediverse (ActivityPub-powered social networks like Mastodon and Pleroma) with Hyperspace Desktop.

The Windows 11 version is much smaller because we no longer need to work around\na platform issue related to our dependencies.\n\nIf you intend on using Terminal as an unpackaged application--that is, extracting the msix file--we recommend that\nyou use the Win10 bundle. You will need the Visual C++ runtime redistributable.\n\nIn addition, if you install the packaged version on either Windows 10 or Windows 11, it now depends on the Visual C++ Universal Runtime Package.\n\nDespite these distributions having different version numbers, they are built from the same code and there is no\nfunctional difference between them.\n\nIf you install the Windows 10 verison on Windows 11, it will probably automatically upgrade itself to the Windows 11\nversion. It turns out that it is impossible to have two bundles with the same version number, so it has to be this\nway.\n\nBug Fixes\n- Usability\n• Terminal can once again be configured as a startup application, and can be detected by tools like PowerToys (#12491)\n• We are once again usable on N (non-media) SKUs of Windows (#12463)\n• There was a puzzling \"Element not found\" error during settings loading; there is no longer such an error (#12687)\n• Terminal will no longer mix up profiles when it is launched in response to a console application spawning (#12484)\n• Formatted copy will now try harder to preserve Unicode charatcers in RTF (#12586) (thanks @ianjoneill!)\n• Displaying multiple dialogs will no longer punch a giant hole in the Terminal (???)

Sie stellt Dir nichtlineare Fits beliebiger Funktionen ebenso wie einen DGL-Löser zur Verfügung. Sie kann 1D- und 2D-Daten mit einem simplen Kommando einfach und publication-ready darstellen. Fouriertransformation ist ebenso enthalten wie Wavelet-Transformationen. Daten werden tabellenbasiert verwaltet und automatisch gesichert, so dass Du nach einem Neustart schnell und unkompliziert weitermachen kannst. EINFACHE AUFGABEN SIND EINFACH - Wir haben nie verstanden, warum man für einfache Dinge genauso viel Code schreiben muss, wie für komplexere Aufgaben. Unser Mantra ist daher Keep simple things simple. SYNTAX SO INTUITIV WIE EINE SPRACHE - NumeRe legt vor allem auf eine möglichst intuitive Bedienung Wert, was eine einfache und möglichst klare Syntax voraussetzt. NumeRe versucht nicht, dynamisch typisiert zu sein, sondern legt bewusst Wert darauf, dass Du bereits beim Lesen des Codes verstehst, was gerade passiert. Zusätzlich hebt der fortgeschrittene Editor verschiedene Datenstrukturen farblich hervor, so dass die Syntax zunächst wohl etwas \"bunt und unruhig\" wirkt. Wir können Dir aber garantieren, dass Du das schon sehr bald zu schätzen weißt. STRUKTUR FEST EINGEBAUT - Beim Schreiben von Prozeduren helfen Dir die fest implementierten Namespaces sofort Ordnung zu halten, da jeder Ordner automatisch einem Namespace entspricht. Dadurch ist es möglich, dass Du mehrere Prozeduren gleichen Namens hast, die dennoch eindeutig sind. Der Editor unterstützt Dich durch Autovervollständigung, sowie durch Darstellung von Tooltips, die Dokumentationen und Signaturen von Funktionen, Kommandos und Prozeduren zeigen.","License":"GNU GPL v3","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null},"en-US":{"Tags":["csv","data-analysis","fitting","ibw","jcamp-dx-jdx-jcm-dx","labx","math","matrix-operation","ndat","nlyt","nprc","nscr","numere","numerical-computation","rapid-prototyping","xls-xlsx-ods"],"Publisher":"Erik Hänel et al.","PublisherUrl":"https://en.numere.org/","Description":"NumeRe: Framework für Numerische Rechnungen is an application for Microsoft Windows® that can do more than the usual spreadsheets. It provides you with nonlinear fits of arbitrary functions as well as a ODE solver. It can display 1D and 2D data easily and publication-ready with a simple command. Fourier transforms are included as well as wavelet transforms. Data is managed in a table-based manner and automatically saved, so you can quickly resume after a restart. SIMPLE TASKS ARE SIMPLE - We never understood why you have to write as much code for simple things as for more complex tasks. Our mantra is therefore Keep simple things simple. SYNTAX AS INTUITIVE AS A LANGUAGE - The main goal is to be as intuitive as possible, which implies a syntax that is as simple and clear as possible. NumeRe does not try to be dynamically typed, but deliberately emphasizes that you understand what is happening as soon as you read the code. In addition, the advanced editor highlights different data structures in different colors, so the syntax may seem a bit \"colorful and choppy\" at first. But we can guarantee that you will appreciate it very soon. STRUCTURE BUILT IN - When writing procedures, the deeply-integrated namespaces help you to keep order right away, because each folder automatically corresponds to a namespace. This makes it possible to have several procedures with the same name that are still unique. The editor supports you by auto-completion, as well as by displaying tooltips that show documentation and signatures of functions, commands and procedures.","License":"GNU GPL v3","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"NurgoSoftware.AquaSnap":{"version":"1.23.15","InstallerType":"wix","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":[],"Publisher":"Nurgo Software","PublisherUrl":null,"Description":"AquaSnap is a tiling window manager for Windows","License":"Freeware","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Nushell.Nushell":{"version":"0.70.0","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["rust","shell"],"Publisher":"The Nushell Project Developers","PublisherUrl":"https://github.com/nushell/nushell","Description":"Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project.\nThe goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development.\nNu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory, traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, functional programming, systems programming, and more.","License":"MIT License","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Nutstore.Nutstore":{"version":"6.1.12","InstallerType":"exe","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["backup","cloud","cloud-drive","download","drive","file","netdisk","share","sync","upload","webdav"],"Publisher":"Shanghai YiCun Network Tech Co., Ltd.","PublisherUrl":"https://www.jianguoyun.com/","Description":"Nutstore is a free cloud storage service that helps you access your files anywhere at any time and share them with friends easily.","License":"Proprietary","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null},"zh-CN":{"Tags":["webdav","上传","下载","云","云盘","共享","分享","同步","备份","文件","网盘"],"Publisher":"上海亦存网络科技有限公司","PublisherUrl":"https://www.jianguoyun.com/","Description":"坚果云是一款提供网盘|云盘|云服务的团队协助软件，可随时随地实现共享文件夹。坚果云网盘支持移动办公，协同办公，文件同步，数据备份，智能管理，在线编辑等功能。","License":"专有软件","ReleaseNotes":"1. 修复某些 Win10 系统上点击主界面的文件夹后出现程序未响应的问题","ReleaseNotesUrl":"https://help.jianguoyun.com/?p=1415"}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Nutstore.NutstoreLightApp":{"version":"2.0.3","InstallerType":"nullsoft","locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["chart","design","diagram","docs","document","draw","editor","graph","graphics","markdown","mind-map","mind-mapping","mindmap","notes","nutstore","outliner"],"Publisher":"上海亦存网络科技有限公司","PublisherUrl":"https://www.jianguoyun.com/","Description":"Nutstore Lightapp","License":"Freeware","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null},"zh-CN":{"Tags":["markdown","图形","图示","图表","坚果云","坚果云轻应用","大纲","思维导图","文档","笔记","绘图","编辑器","脑图","设计"],"Publisher":"上海亦存网络科技有限公司","PublisherUrl":"https://www.jianguoyun.com/","Description":"坚果云轻应用","License":"免费软件","ReleaseNotes":[],"ReleaseNotesUrl":null}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Nvidia.Broadcast":{"version":"1.3.0.45","Platform":["Windows.Desktop"],"locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["broadcast","nvidia"],"Publisher":"Nvidia","PublisherUrl":"https://www.nvidia.com/","Description":"The NVIDIA Broadcast app transforms any room into a home studio.

containers can now be rotated.\n• Added logs folder shortcut to settings tab.\n• The user interface is now locked behind a loading screen while big operations are performed and the user interface shouldn't be touched.\n\nChanged\n• Changed license from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later\n• Changed how saves and objects are handled internally.\n• Improved particle flows performances when using a big amount of particles.\n• Optimized bar visualizers when changing their parameters.\n• Improved visual updates of particle flows and visualizers while audio is paused or stopped.\n• Changing an object's name is now done using a dedicated field in the rack (less clicks!).\n• Changed rules for timers positioning. (The converter should reajust timers when opening a project from an older version.)\n• Changed some default values (it only affects newly created objects and new object parameters).\n• The default color is now randomized.\n• Irrelevant options (i.e that have no effect) in some objects are no longer available (timers, visualizers). In consequence they are no longer stored as well with these objects (as they are useless).\n• Made top user interface for audio and zoom control more compact.\n• Split audio control block in half in the top user interface for better display in a smaller window.\n• Improved help on object creation.\n• Improved responsiveness on window resize.\n\nRemoved\n• Removed background visual object that duplicates image/shape visual object. Existing background visual objects in older saves will be converted to image visual objects.\n\nFixed\n• Video export via CLI works again.\n• Particle flow's flow type parameter provides help again.\n• When opening a new save, existing user interface from old visual objects are now effectively removed.\n• Interacting with control panel's top tabs no longer moves the rest of the user interface.\n• The top of the screen was hard to see, and hidden no matter what behind the top user interface (in some zoom and window size scenarios). There is now a minimum of padding above the screen.\n• The window no longer flashes to white when being first opened.\n• Changing the color of a waves visualizer while audio is paused now updates the color visually. Same for particle flows.\n• About section no longer have the text centered.\n\nSecurity\n• Updated Electron from v12 to v16.\n• Updated dependencies in general\n• \nKnown issues\n• Using audio extensions that have capital letters in it can cause issues at export. To avoid this bug, use extensions without any capital letters (like .wav instead of .Wav or .WAV).","ReleaseNotesUrl":"https://github.com/Picorims/wav2bar/releases/tag/v0.3.0-beta"}},"DefaultLocale":"en-US"},"Pidgin.Pidgin":{"version":"2.14.10","InstallerType":"nullsoft","Platform":["Windows.Desktop"],"locals":{"en-US":{"Tags":["aim","bonjour","chat","facebook","icq","irc","jabber","messenger","xmpp"],"Publisher":"Pidgin IM","PublisherUrl":"https://pidgin.im","Description":"Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously.

This fixes the debugger for clauses holding $/0.\n- FIXED: Avoid instantiation error on =../2 when analysing clause positions with incomplete information.\n\n[Feb 14 2022]\n- SANDBOX: SWISH issue#147: Allow for copy_term/4.\n- FIXED: Allow retry from the body of => rules.\n- ENHANCED: Avoid tracing inside spy/1, nospy/1 and related debug control predicates.\n- FIXED: Issue#935: package manager: download location of git archives\n- DOC: Remove obsolete reference of break/1 trace port\n\n[Mar 22 2022]\n- FIXED: Issue#963: possible undefined to_list/2 in message handling.

See the two Notes above.\n  - Fixed playing music externally and then running your game could crash the game or result in broken audio\n  - Fixed getting a call or other system notification sound crashed your game\n  - Fixed the iPhone X home bar being visible all the time\n  - Fixed message dialogs to stop crashes when trying to show code errors on iOS 11+ because the OS has changed how message dialogs work\n  - Ignore GGS's \"Minimum Time to Display\" to fix black splash screen on startup if you had set this option greater than 0 in versions since we changed the splash screen method\n  - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead\n- Ubuntu\n  - Fixed the name of the audio library the runner looks for on starting the game - fixes lack of audio for some users\n  - Fixed \"Error deleting sources + buffers\" error when trying to close games\n  - Fixed sounds popping when stopped if another sound is played directly afterwards\n- Android\n  - Fixed memory leak when using HTTP functionality and also a memory management issue which could have crashed the game if lots of HTTP traffic\n  - Deprecated the synchronous developer get_...() dialog functions, so they now do nothing in-game (avoids errors) - use the ..._async() versions instead\n- UWP\n  - Fixed the window size always being locked to a fixed size dictated by the UWP tools\n  - Fixed url_open() so it now works the same as Windows native\n- HTML5\n  - Fixed 0029360: HTML5: Audio doesn't play on iOS Safari, iOS Chrome or Android Chrome\n  - NOTE: Fix is for iOS and Android only - Windows Chrome betas currently exhibit this also, but Chrome are not yet committed to keeping the change on desktops\n  - NOTE: This change does mean initial loading times for HTML5 will now be longer while the audio files in your game are downloaded\n  - Fixed Mouse Pressed events not working on scaled canvases because the collision mask is offset\n  - Fixed mouse coordinates aren't scaled to match when your window or view is scaled\n  - Fixed functions to set the gain on an audio resource so they work as per native platforms\n  - Fixed high refresh rate monitors cause the game to run quicker than intended in Chrome and Firefox\n- Changed the default size of the GUI layer\n  - Changed the default GUI size for Draw GUI events to match the application_surface size so it is more consistent cross-platform\n  - Fixes various issues, such as text placement on some platforms (e.g., Mac)\n  - NOTE: If you use a Draw GUI event to scale your GUI and draw the application_surface, you might need to change your project to maintain your expected results:\n  - In your first object's Create/Game Start, you could do \"var pos = application_get_position(); display_set_gui_maximise(1, 1, pos[0], pos[1]);\"\n  - Depending on your project, you might find also that simply changing your Draw GUI event to be a Post Draw gives the intended result\n  - See the manual for more information\n- Fast Collisions Fixes\n  - Lots of fixes have been added for the Fast-Collisions system (if you enabled this for your project in GGS)\n  - Includes deactivating and reactivating instances doesn't refresh collision status, collision information persisting in the wrong room or after game_restart()\n  - Multiple fixes for Spine sprites and collisions, also ensuring that Animation Events fire correctly\n- New Audio System Fixes\n  - Lots of fixes for the new audio engine released with 1804\n  - Better support for stereo files being incorrectly used for positional audio\n  - Fixes for: volume levels and sync groups, audio distortion or lower quality output files than expected, whitespace \"hissing\" from very high bitrate ogg files, and more\n  - Fixes for the wrong sounds playing on audio_play_sound(), especially after using an emitter to play audio.\n- Misc\n  -
